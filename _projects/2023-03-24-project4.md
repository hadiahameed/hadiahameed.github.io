A project for finance industry or a hypothetical bank. Using machine learning models to predict whether a particular customer will default on their loan or not, based on different demographic indicators collected for the individual.

## Importance:
- Banks want to reduce their credit risk. The recession in 2008 in the US happened because mortgage loans were given to people with bad credit scores resulting in a lot of people defaulting due to which a lot of banks and investors had to face huge financial losses.

## Glossary:

- **Credit Risk Modeling** : Using data about a person to predict the probability of that person paying back the loan.
- **Default risk** : A person's probability to not pay back their loan. Banks use this to calculate the interest rate for a person. They charge people interest rates that are proportional to their default risk.

## About the Dataset:

Data Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset"> Credit Risk Dataset, Kaggle</a> 

| Column | Description |

| person_age | Age | numerical |
| person_home_ownership | home ownership status  | RENT, MORTGAGE, OWN, OTHER |
| person_emp_length | Employment length (in years) | numerical |
| loan_intent | Whether they own a home or not  | PERSONAL, EDUCATION, MEDICAL, VENTURE, HOMEIMPROVEMENT, DEBTCONSOLIDATION |
| loan_grade | Loan grade | 'D', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'F', 'G' |
| loan_amnt | Loan amount| numerical |
| loan_int_rate | Interest rate | numerical |
| loan_percent_income | Loan to income ratio | numerical |
| cb_person_default_on_file | Historical default | 'Y', 'N'|
| cb_person_cred_hist_length | credit history length | numerical |

## Models and Technologies:

- **Azure Data Studio**: Data in csv file loaded to SQL database created in Azure Data Studio. SQL server started on a Docker container.

- **Tableau**: Connected to SQL database and built a dashboard for data visualization.

- **Python Jupyter Notebook**: Built a machine learning pipeline using sklearn, pandas and XGboost to develop a classifier for predicting whether a person will default on their loan or not.

- **Flask Web application**: Developed a python application using flask that takes certain inputs and used the already trained model in the backend to predict whether this new person will default on their loan or not.

- **Google Cloud Platform**: Hosted the Flask app on GCP.
