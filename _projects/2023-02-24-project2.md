A project for finance industry or a hypothetical bank. Using machine learning models to predict whether a particular customer will default on their loan or not, based on different demographic indicators collected for the individual.

## Importance:
- Banks want to reduce their credit risk. The recession in 2008 in the US happened because mortgage loans were given to people with bad credit scores resulting in a lot of people defaulting due to which a lot of banks and investors had to face huge financial losses.

## Glossary:

- **Credit Risk Modeling** : Using data about a person to predict the probability of that person paying back the loan.
- **Default risk** : A person's probability to not pay back their loan. Banks use this to calculate the interest rate for a person. They charge people interest rates that are proportional to their default risk.
