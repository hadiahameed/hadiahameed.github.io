## Overview: 


## Glossary:

- **Credit Risk Modeling** : Using data about a person to predict the probability of that person paying back the loan.
- **Default risk** : A person's probability to not pay back their loan. Banks use this to calculate the interest rate for a person. They charge people interest rates that are proportional to their default risk.
