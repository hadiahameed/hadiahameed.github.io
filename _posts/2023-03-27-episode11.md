This is part of a series of posts on some of my notes from course on Machine Learning Specialization taught by Prof. Andrew Ng[1].

## Concepts:  

+ <span style="color:blue">For anomaly detection, in what cases do we prefer supervised learning and when do we use unsupervised learning?</span>       

  In anomaly detection, we are dealing with an imbalanced dataset. 

  - **Unsupervised learning:**
      - when we have a very small number of positive examples (0 - 20 is common) and a large number of negative examples. Supervised learning: Otherwise.
      - Anomalous behavior has no discernible pattern. Each time the anomaly can occur in a different way. Unsupervised learning methods e.g. density estimation are independent of this as they try to model the behavior of normally occurring phenomenon and everything outside it is considered as an anomaly. 
      - Choice of features for anomaly detection is extremely important.

  - **Supervised learning:**
      - 20 or more positive examples.
      - Here we try to learn the behavior of anomalous examples. Based on the assumption that future anomalous examples will look like the existing ones. 
      - Choosing redundant or extra features doesn't cause much harm as the algorithm takes care of it. 

  Examples:
  - Fraud detection in banks, monitoring machines in data center (Unsupervised)
  - Email spam, disease classfication, weather prediction (Supervised) 


+ <span style="color:blue">What are some of the ways you can convert non-gaussian features to gaussian and why is it important?</span>  
  If we are estimating the probability distribution of the negative (non-anomalous) examples using a gaussian distribution that it is important to convert all the features to a gaussian distribution. 

  If x is some feature with non-gaussian distribution then we can convert it to gaussian through the following transformations:

  $$ log(x)\\
  log(x + c\*) $$ 
  $$ \sqrt(x)\\
  x^\frac{1}{3} $$

  \* where c is some constant value selected by hit and trial. We add this to avoid log(0) case.

+ <span style="color:blue">What do we do when, after building our density estimation model we find out that the probability of an anomalous event is close to a normal event?</span>   

   In these cases, it helps to come up with a derived variables e.g. ratio of a feature that takes a very small value for anomalies and a feature that take very high value in case of anomalies.

+ <span style="color:blue">What is mean normalization, why do we do it when building recommender systems? When do we do it row wise and when is it done column wise?</span>   

   Mean normalization is done by subtracting mean of every feature from each value of the feature.
   Generally, it is done to scale features. To bring all values to the same range. When it is divided by the range, the features are scaled. 

   <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/mean_norm.png" width="55%" height="55%"> 

   If the denominator is standard deviation, then it the process is called standardization. The resulting distribution has 0 mean and unit variance. 

   <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/mean_norm1.png" width="55%" height="55%"> 

   Optimization algorithms converge faster when the features are scaled. 

   In recommender systems, we only do mean normalization (subtract mean from each value of the rating in the per-item matrix). If a new user shows up in the system and we have not done mean normalization, then the algorithm will assume that the new user will give 0 rating to every movie. But after mean normalization, the algorithm will assume that the new user will rate each movie according to the average rating of that movie based on existing users. For this we do row wise mean normalization (items are in the rows and users are in the columns of the matrix).

   If a new movie shows up and no user has rated it yet, then in order to estimate it's ratings, we do column wise mean normalization. But this is not advisable.

## Thought of the Week:  

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is here! It is now the largest language model that we know of, developed by an independent lab called OpenAI in San Francisco. It has 175 billion parameters and has been trained on millions of text documents including Google books and Wikipedia articles. The underlying principle behind GPT modeling is semi-supervised learning which means to train the model on a large-sized unlabeled data in unsupervised manner and then fine-tune it by supervised learning on small set of labeled examples. [4]  

Even though GPT-3 was developed for sentence completion tasks by its developers but it turns out that it can also be used to write code! Seems like it's time for us computer scientists to get insecure about our jobs. Check out this interesting article in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/science/artificial-intelligence-ai-gpt3.html"> New York Times</a> to know more fun stuff about GPT-3. 

 Until next time!
