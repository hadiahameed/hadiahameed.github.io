This post acts as a handy cheat sheet on how to draw important inferences from a given dataset using statistics and hypothesis testing.  

## Dataset:

Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year) was taken from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/citywide-payroll-data-fiscal-year">"Data.gov"</a>. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation.

For the purpose of simplicity, I have extracted the base salaries for two departments i.e. Police department and Social Services for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and have taken a subset of relevant columns.

## Concepts:  

+ <span style="color:blue">Step 0: Descriptive statistics and their interpretation.</span>       
We use the Data Analysis toolpack in Excel to quickly get descriptive stats for the two departments. Refer to sheet **"descriptive_stats"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].

We make the following observations and come up with relevant questions related to these observations which we will later answer through various statistical tests: 

- The police department has on average higher salary than social services. 
  - *Is this difference statistically significant?*  

- The police department's salaries vary a bit more than the social services department as shown by the standard deviation.  

- Median salary is lower than mean salary (excluding Police 2021). 
  - This implies a right/positive skew. 
  - But the small value for "Skew" for police shows that the tails don't extend too far to the right. 
  - Kurtosis less than 3 also shows that the distribution for police's salaries is thin-tailed and outlier frequency is low. 
  - Kurtosis is > 3 for Social Services which implies a higher outlier frequency and fat-tailed distribution.

### Inferential Statistics:  

1. ### Confidence Interval for Mean, Single population: 

+ <span style="color:blue">Step 1(a): If we know the population variance for the salary of each department, calculate the confidence interval for the mean salary of a police officer and a social worker in New York for the year 2020. Assume that the police department's salary has a population standard deviation of $80k and social services has a population standard deviation of $60k.</span>  

Refer to sheet **"1. Known variance, CI, z-table"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].  

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/episode_12_image_5.png">  
  <figcaption>Case 1 (a): Confidence intervals. Population known, z-table. </figcaption>
</figure>  

<p style="color:red"> Interpretation: We are 95% confident that a police officer's salary was from $67,794 to $69,256 and a social worker's salary was from $57,861 to $60,050 in NYC in 2020.</p>

+ <span style="color:blue">Step 1(b): If we do not know the population variance for the salary of each department, calculate the confidence interval for the mean salary of a police officer and a social worker in New York for the year 2020.</span>


Refer to sheet **"2. Unkown var, CI, t-table"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].  

<figure>

  <figcaption>Case 1 (b): Confidence intervals. Population uknown, t-table.</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p style="color:red"> Interpretation: We are 95% confident that a police officer's salary was from $68,219 to $68,830 and a social worker's salary was from $58,511 to $59,400 in NYC in 2020.</p>

2. ### Confidence Interval for Mean Difference, Dependent Samples: 

+ <span style="color:blue">Step 2: We are interested in knowing the salary increase for each department from 2020 to 2021. Calculate the confidence interval for that increase with 95% confidence.</span>


Refer to sheet **"3. Two Means Dependent Samples"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].  

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/episode_12_image_7.png">  
  <figcaption>Case 2: Confidence interval for difference of two means, dependent samples</a></figcaption>
</figure> 

<p style="color:red"> Interpretation: We are 95% confident that there was a salary increase of $2,113 to $2,237 for the police department. The whole interval is positive so we can be sure that the salary has increased.      

We are 95% confident that there was a salary increase of $439 to $513 for the social services department. The whole interval is positive so we can be sure that the salary has increased.   
</p>

3. ### Confidence Interval for Mean Difference, Independent Samples

+ <span style="color:blue">Step 3(a): We are interested in knowing the salary difference between police and social services. Calculate the confidence interval for that difference with 95% confidence. Assume that the police department's salary has a population standard deviation of $80k and social services has a population standard deviation of $60k.</span>


Refer to sheet **"4. Two Mean Ind Samp, known var"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].

  <figcaption>Case 3 (a): Confidence interval for difference of two means, independent samples, population variance known.</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p style="color:red"> Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true mean difference between police department and Social Services department falls in the interval [$8,253 , $10,885] in 2020.</p>


+ <span style="color:blue">Step 3(b): We are interested in knowing the salary difference between police and social services. Calculate the confidence interval for that difference with 95% confidence. We do not known the population variance but we know it's almost equal for both departments.</span>

<p style="color:red"> Interpretation: We are 95% confident that police department has $8-10k higher salaries than social services in 2020.</p>


### Hypothesis Testing 

1. ### t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means:

+ <span style="color:blue"> Hari Singh is a pessimistic police officer and says there was no significant increase in NYPD salaries from 2020 to 2021. Run a hypothesis test to prove him right or wrong. Run a similar test for Social Services department.</span>

We use **t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means** from Data Anlysis Toolpack in Excel.

Refer to sheet **"8. Test for mean. Dep samples"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].  

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/episode_12_image_10.png">  
  <figcaption>Case 4 (a): Checking if there is a significant mean difference between two dependent samples.</figcaption>
</figure> 

<ul style="color:red"> 

  <li> We say that the null hypothesis is that the difference in salaries in 2020 and 2021 is less than or equal to $1000.</li>

  <li>  A p-value is a probability that the results from the sample dataset are occurred by chance. Low p-values are considered good. Small p-value shows that we can reject the null hypothesis.</li>

  <li> We reject the null hypothesis because t Stat 37 > t critical one-tail of 1.64.</li> 

  <li> Hari Singh is wrong. NYPD's salaries have increased from 2020 to 2021.</li>

  </ul>

2. ### t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means:

+ <span style="color:blue"> Christina works in NYC's social services department and thinks that NYPD is being paid $10k or more on average than SS department. Run a hypothesis test to prove her right or wrong.</span>

We use **t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances** from Data Anlysis Toolpack in Excel.

Refer to sheet **"10. Test for mean, Ind samples"** in inferential_stats_case_study.xlsx [1].  

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/episode_12_image_11.png">  
  <figcaption>Case 4 (a): Checking if there is a significant mean difference between two dependent samples.</figcaption>
</figure> 

<p style="color:red"> Christina is wrong for 2020 but spot for 2021! Social services was paid less than NYPD in 2021 by more than $10k.</p>
