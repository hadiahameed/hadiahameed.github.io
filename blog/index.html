<p> In my blog posts, I generally talk about the most interesting thing I have learned during the week, followed by a small coding exercise and in the end, I share a useful thought of the week which I have somehow discovered serendipitously while <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133923-everything-happens-for-a-reason" target="_blank">"scrounging around in my life for things to improve"</a> . Hope it helps you too. Happy reading!
