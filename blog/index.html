<p> When Richard Feynman explained the difference between “knowing something” and “knowing the name of something”, 
  he presented his secret formula for effective learning. The trick was simple. When you learn a new concept and want 
  to build a ground-up understanding of it, simply teach it to a child, review it, organize and simplify and then transmit it.
</p>
<p>So, I am excited to try the
  <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-secret-algorithm-behind-learning?fbclid=IwAR0hL-YkrYMUyCDGaAlMlazt9e8eJFZv_52WMq6GV0JzADlV7M6bnwRXCOk" target="_blank">Feynman technique</a> 
  and write a weekly blog post on the most interesting things I have learned during the week. There is a deluge of resources 
  on data science and I often find myself dabbling in exploring data science blog posts, videos, and podcasts and have a 
  hard time remembering the things I have learned.
</p>
<p> However, lately, I have realized that writing gives me closure and helps 
  me demystify complicated concepts. In my blog posts, I generally talk about a new thing I have learned 
  during the week, followed by a small coding exercise and in the end, I share a useful thought of the week which I have 
  somehow discovered serendipitously while <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133923-everything-happens-for-a-reason" target="_blank">"scrounging around in my life for things to improve"</a>. These are just informal, mini episodes summarizing my readings/research/reflections. 
  Feel free to make them richer with relevant comments and feedback. Happy reading!
