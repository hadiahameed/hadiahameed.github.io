      <blockquote>
         <p>"The crisis of climate change, in particular, is a crisis of disconnection between the facts and the feelings. We know something is true; we don’t feel that it’s true. We don’t live as if it’s true. There is what you might call a kind of stealth denial. We speak as if we believed it, but it’s not obvious from our behavior and the way we vote and what we campaign for, how we talk, that we accept this as a real problem."</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic"> - Jonathan Rowson in conversation with Krista Tippett, On Being</p>

      <blockquote>
         <p>"The point isn’t that any one comment or incident is going to push a woman out of tech or make her miserable at work. It’s the constant emotional labor that she has to perform, day after day, just to keep her job and do her work. Often, women will not immediately blame sexism if they feel they are being mistreated or overlooked, rather they question themselves. “Did I do something wrong?” Or, was I not clear enough?” they might think. These concerns wear constantly on self-esteem. Pushing against a stereotype is emotional labor that men, white men in particular, don’t have to perform. Instead, they can use that energy to focus on being a great engineer. Women and minorities, on the other hand, start and end the day at an emotional deficit. It is this “death by a thousand cuts” phenomenon that wears women down – not because they are weak, or because they can’t keep up, but because they are doing a whole extra job."</p>
